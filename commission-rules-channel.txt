__**Commission Rules**__
This is the perfect place to start before hiring or getting hired here.

**1. Commissions CANNOT be 18+**
The reasoning for this is that we want everyone 13+ to be able to make commissions and get hired without waiting several years to be 18.

**2. No inappropriate commissions**
Doing this will get you permanently banned since we want to stay with the no 18+ rule.

**3. Creating commissions to threaten people is prohibited**
We do not want anyone threatened in Obby Creator Commissions because we highly prohibit and do not want any threats.

**4. Commissions MUST be Obby Creator related.**
Must be in the official Obby Creator game and must relate to some sort of help inside the game.

**5. Commissions MUST be safe**
Any commissions that have links that grab your IP or any links at all (Official Obby Creator Link is allowed) will get you banned. This includes commissions that try to get your name, address, postcode, username and password, and much more.

**6. Make your commission stand out**
People regularly don't get interested if the commission is the same as another, so try to make your one unique.

**Staff will keep you safe, in both #ü§ùÔΩúhiring-people and #üñêÔΩúgetting-hired channels.**

**Any questions or help may go to @Roundedly#7877 or @3dv!t#3429.**

**Any rule violated will also be counted as a warning.**
**If you get over 3 warnings in 1 month, you will be banned for a week.**
